The `kv.set` processor sets the value associated with a key from a compatible module. The payload is unchanged so whatever is received by this payload is output unless any errors are encountered.

- **type**: `kv.set`
- **params**:
    - **module**: id of the module
    - **key**: the key to look up
    - **value**: the value to set

### Example
This will attempt to set the key `hello` to `world` using the module with an id of `redis`
```yaml
- type: kv.set
  params:
    module: redis
    key: hello
    value: world
```
