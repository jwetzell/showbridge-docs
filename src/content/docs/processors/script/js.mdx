The `script.js` processor takes in any payload type and executes a JavaScript function that is able to process the payload. The end value of `payload` will be returned as the output of the processor.

Ending with a `payload` value of `undefined` is treated the same as any other processor returning `nil`.

This run your JavaScript program in a [sandboxed environment](https://gitlab.com/cznic/quickjs). It currently support the [ES2023](https://tc39.es/ecma262/2023/) specification.

    program: |
        payload = payload.replaceAll('|',',');
```
