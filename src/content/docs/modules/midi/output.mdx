<Aside type="caution">
This module is not currently included in the pre-compiled binaries for [showbridge](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge-go/releases/latest)
</Aside>

The `midi.output` module connects to a midi device (or virtual device) and allows sending MIDI messages out to that device. This module does not receive any message and so using it as an `input` to a [route](/concepts/routes) would be pointless.

- **type**: `midi.output`
- **params**:
    - **port**: name of the MIDI port to connect to

### Example
Open a MIDI connection to `Logic Pro Virtual In`.
```
- id: midiOutput
  type: midi.output
  params:
    port: "Logic Pro Virtual In"
```
