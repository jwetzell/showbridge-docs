The `serial.client` module connects to a serial device and emits a message messages based on the data it receives from the port. Messages are determined by "framing" techniques as serial is a stream based protocol.

- **type**: `serial.client`
- **params**:
    - **port**: serial port to connect to i.e `/dev/ttyS0`
    - **baudRate** baud rate to use when connecting to serial port
    - **framing**: how to chunk the serial stream into "messages"
        - LF `\n`
        - CR `\r`
        - CRLF `\r\n`
        - [SLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol)
        - RAW (no framing is done bytes are sent out as they are received)

### Example
Open a serial connection to `/dev/ttyS0` with a buad rate of `115200`, any incoming data will be split on line-feed (`\n`)
```
- id: serialClient
  type: serial.client
  params:
    port: "/dev/ttyS0"
    baudRate: 115200
    framing: LF
```
