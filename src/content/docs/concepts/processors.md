Processors are anything that create or manipulate messages. They are configured in the `processors` property of an individual [route](/reference/routes). Processors have the ability to change the type of the message flowing through the system so a byte array can come into a `osc.message.decode` processor and a OSC message type will come out of the processor.

## YAML Definition
A processor YAML block has the following properties

- **type**: the processor type
- **params**: optional map for processor configuration values. The valid values will depend on the processor type
