<Aside type="caution">
This module is not currently included in the pre-compiled binaries for [showbridge](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge-go/releases/latest)
</Aside>

The `midi.input` module connects to a midi device (or virtual device) and emits MIDI messages that come in on that port. This module does not output any message and so using it as an `output` of a [route](/concepts/routes) would be pointless.

- **type**: `midi.input`
- **params**:
    - **port**: name of the MIDI port to connect to

### Example
Open a MIDI connection to `Logic Pro Virtual Out`.
```
- id: midiInput
  type: midi.input
  params:
    port: "Logic Pro Virtual Out"
```
